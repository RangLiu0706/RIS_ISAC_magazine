Abstract of the paper: 
Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler to address the growing spectrum congestion problem and satisfy increasing demands for ubiquitous sensing and communication. By sharing various resources and information, ISAC achieves much higher spectral, energy, hardware, and economic efficiencies. Concurrently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has been deemed as a promising approach due to its capability of intelligently manipulating the wireless propagation environment in an energy and hardware efficient manner. Given the extensive research on RIS-assisted communications, in this article we mainly focus on the potential of deploying RIS to improve sensing performance and enhance the trade-off between communication and sensing performance. We first describe the fundamentals of RIS and its applications in traditional communication and sensing systems, then introduce the principles of ISAC and overview existing explorations on RIS-assisted ISAC, followed by one case study to verify the advantages of deploying RIS in ISAC systems. Finally, open challenges and research directions are discussed to stimulate this line of research and pave the way for practical applications.
